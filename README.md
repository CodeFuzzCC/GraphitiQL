**giraffeQL** is an open source tool that visualizes your PostgreSQL relationships to easily configure your database for a GraphQL API. An interactive canvas display automatically populates with data from any PostgreSQL URI, that can be reorganized to easily catch any human error before exporting code. In other words, you can drag-and-drop colorful tables and export Javascript!

**giraffeQL** allows users to drag-and-drop nodes, create new tables, connect columns, and edit data while seeing their changes take effect in a real-time GraphQL code preview, seperated by TypeDefs and custom resolvers. The code can be exported ready-to-go in any application.

Check us out at https://giraffeql.io/.

### **How to use**
- **Sign-in page**: Sign up for an account through GitHub OAuth, or just continue as a guest. Registered users enjoy additional project-saving functionality.
- **Start a new diagram**: Choose between uploading an existing PostgreSQL URI to auto-populate your data or starting from scratch.
